            <p>
              I enjoy making web applications, hybrid mobile apps and sometimes games. Last one currently for pure fun.
              No challenge is too great and sky is the limit.

              Why I actually do this? Due to pure love of development. It's basically like Lego bricks -
              enjoyable, challenging, and unquestionably awesome.
